# Municipal Government Design Systems & Pattern Library directory

## Background
While there is a robust conversation around federal (and sometimes, state) government innovation, local governments are slower to reach the innovation game. For every big city that's leading the way, there are lots of smaller places around the world with folks sharing what they know. I thought it'd be useful to have a centralized place for local government design systems & pattern libraries that are open sourced, so others can learn, share and remix.
